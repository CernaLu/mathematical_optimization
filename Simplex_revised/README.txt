Mathematical Optimization: Simplex Revised
____________________________
----------------------------

1) Input and Output:

    For the tableu input edit 'input.txt'. The 
    input to the file must be like the next 
    example: (strings after '#' are comments)
    
        -5 -8 -7 -4 -6 0  #Z function
        2 3 3 2 2 20      #Restriction 
        3 5 4 2 4 30      #Restriction 1
        
    Where the last column of each row corresponds
    to the constants on every equation.
    Everything after '#' are also comments for
    the implementation, so this wouldn't affect
    when running.
    
    The output whill be written in a file called:
    'output.txt'
    
2) Compiling and Running

    Just run the 'simplex_revised.py' file running:
    python simplex_revised.py
